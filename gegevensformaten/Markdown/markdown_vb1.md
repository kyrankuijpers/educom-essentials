# Markdown in [MailMate][]

Note that *this* message has no HTML body part. Based on the
`Content-Type` header, the receiving email client could do the
conversion, but if it is not able to do so then this is still readable
plain text.

In the eyes of an email client developer, this is a beautiful raw email.
Nicely sorted headers and no hideous quoted-printable encoding (or
base64) even though long lines and non-ASCII like &aelig;&oslash;&aring; is used.
